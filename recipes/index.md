!!! tip "All You Really Need To Know About Converting Fresh Herbs to Dry Herbs"
    * The general rule for *dried “flaky” herbs* like dried cilantro or dried tarragon is **3 to 1** or three parts fresh to one part dried.
    * If you are working with *dried ground herbs* like ground ginger which is going to be even more potent than the dried flaky herbs, the general ratio is **4 to 1** or four parts fresh to one part dried.
