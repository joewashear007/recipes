#Homemade Oreos
----

##Cookie:
* 1  1/4 cups all purpose flour
* 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1 to 1  1/2 cups sugar (I use 1  1/2)

1. Preheat to oven to 375

2. Mix flour, cocoa, baking soda and powder, salt, butter, and egg. If the dough seems a little dry, just add a small amount of vegetable
 oil.CAUTION: BE SURE TO MIX SUGAR ONLY AFTER ALL OTHER INGREDIENTS HAVE COMBINED...

3. Make cookies flat and circular when placing on a paper-lined cookie sheet, maybe one to two inches apart depending on how big you make them; they hardly expand in the oven.

4. Bake for 9 minutes
 
##Cookie Filling:
* 1/4 cup room temperature, unsalted butter
* 1/4 cup vegetable shortening
* 2 cups sifted confectioners' sugar
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

1. Mix all ingredients.

2. Place filling between two cookies

3. I usually end up doubling the filling recipe, its pretty flexible; it all depends on how much frosting you like. 
Enjoy!
